Ground truth labels are essential for supervised learning, providing a benchmark for evaluating centrality-based predictions.\\In our datasets, these labels reflect true node rankings, derived from accurate and up-to-date Glicko ratingsâ€”independent of sampled game data.\\Examples include Survivor contestant outcomes (Sole survivor, runner-up, or voted out), as well as Chess \& Dota 2 (Glicko rating of player or team skill).\\

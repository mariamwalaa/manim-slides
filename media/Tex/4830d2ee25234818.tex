We showed that the CON score is a highly effective predictive feature, often outperforming traditional centrality measures like PageRank, closeness, and betweenness.\\Extend this work to other kinds of adversarial datasets in biology or economics (e.g. animal dominance or food webs).\\Extend the CON score to provide predictive models with more information and globalize the metric.\\Evaluate the contribution of each centrality measure to the machine learning models at the node level.\\Test the hypothesis on other kinds of adversarial networks (different from competition networks) and on random graphs.\\

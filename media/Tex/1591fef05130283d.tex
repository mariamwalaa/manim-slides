In modern network science, centrality measures are used to study real-life networks -- urban networks, brain networks, social networks, and more. Recently, they have also been used in machine learning prediction tasks.\\Some of the most common centrality measures include degree, closeness, betweenness, and PageRank. Essentially, they help identify influential nodes and are often local metrics.\\

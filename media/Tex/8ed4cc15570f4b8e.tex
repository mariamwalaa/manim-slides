Mathematically, it is a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, where each node $u \in V$ represents a competitor, and a directed edge $(u, v) \in E$ exists if $u$ has defeated $v$ at least once in a competition.\\On expectation, these are close to being directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).\\They can be used to model various competitive scenarios, such as eSports, reality shows, and more.\\

We showed that the CON score is a highly effective predictive feature, often outperforming traditional centrality measures like PageRank, closeness, and betweenness.\\More can be done! We can extend this work to other kinds of adversarial datasets in biology or economics (e.g. animal dominance or food webs), or on random graphs.\\We can also extend the CON score to provide predictive models with more information and globalize the metric.\\
